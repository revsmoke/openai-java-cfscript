     * Currently, an Upload can accept at most 8 GB in total and expires after an hour after you
     * create it.
     *
     * Once you complete the Upload, we will create a
     * [File](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/files/object) object that contains all
     * the parts you uploaded. This File is usable in the rest of our platform as a regular File
     * object.
     *
     * For certain `purpose`s, the correct `mime_type` must be specified. Please refer to
     * documentation for the supported MIME types for your use case:
     * - [Assistants](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/tools/file-search#supported-files)
     *
     * For guidance on the proper filename extensions for each purpose, please follow the
     * documentation on
     * [creating a File](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/files/create).
